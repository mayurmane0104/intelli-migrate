---

This topic describes some of the commands you can use to manage Amazon S3 buckets and objects
    using the
      [ aws s3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/index.html)
    commands in the AWS CLI. For commands not covered in this topic and additional command examples,
    see the
      

[commands in the](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/index.html)

`aws s3`*AWS CLI Reference*.

The high-level `aws s3` commands simplify managing Amazon S3 objects. These commands
    enable you to manage the contents of Amazon S3 within itself and with local directories.

###### Topics

## Prerequisites

    To run the `s3` commands, you need to:

- Install and configure the AWS CLI. For more information, see - [Installing or updating to the latest version of the AWS CLI](./getting-started-install.html)and- [Authentication and access credentials for the AWS CLI](./cli-chap-authentication.html).
- 
        The profile that you use must have permissions that allow the AWS operations performed by the examples. 
- 
        Understand these Amazon S3 terms: - 
            Bucket – A top-level Amazon S3 folder. 
- 
            Prefix – An Amazon S3 folder in a bucket. 
- 
            Object – Any item that's hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket. 
 
- 
            

## Before you start

    This section describes a few things to note before you use `aws s3`
      commands.

### Large object uploads

When you use `aws s3` commands to upload large objects to an Amazon S3 bucket, the
        AWS CLI automatically performs a multipart upload. You can't resume a failed upload when using
        these `aws s3` commands. 

If the multipart upload fails due to a timeout, or if you manually canceled in the AWS CLI, the AWS CLI stops the upload and cleans up any files that were created. This process can take several minutes.

If the multipart upload or cleanup process is canceled by a kill command or system
        failure, the created files remain in the Amazon S3 bucket. To clean up the multipart upload, use
        the
          [s3api abort-multipart-upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/abort-multipart-upload.html) command.

### File properties and tags in multipart copies

When you use the AWS CLI version 1 version of commands in the `aws s3` namespace to
        copy a file from one Amazon S3 bucket location to another Amazon S3 bucket location, and that
        operation uses [multipart copy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/CopyingObjctsMPUapi.html), no
        file properties from the source object are copied to the destination object.

By
          default, the AWS CLI version 2 commands in the `s3` namespace that perform multipart
          copies transfers all tags and the following set of properties from the source to the
          destination copy: `content-type`, `content-language`,
            `content-encoding`, `content-disposition`,
            `cache-control`, `expires`, and `metadata`.

This can result in additional AWS API calls to the Amazon S3 endpoint that would not have
          been made if you used AWS CLI version 1. These can include: `HeadObject`,
            `GetObjectTagging`, and `PutObjectTagging`.

If you need to change this default behavior in AWS CLI version 2 commands, use the
            `--copy-props` parameter to specify one of the following options:

- 
            **default**– The default value. Specifies that the copy includes all tags attached to the source object and the properties encompassed by the`--metadata-directive`parameter used for non-multipart copies:`content-type`,`content-language`,`content-encoding`,`content-disposition`,`cache-control`,`expires`, and`metadata`.
- 
            **metadata-directive**– Specifies that the copy includes only the properties that are encompassed by the`--metadata-directive`parameter used for non-multipart copies. It doesn't copy any tags.
- 
            **none**– Specifies that the copy includes none of the properties from the source object.

## Create a bucket

    Use the
        [ s3 mb](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/mb.html) command
      to make a bucket. Bucket names must be 

**unique (unique across all of Amazon S3) and should be DNS compliant.**

*globally*Bucket names can contain lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and periods. Bucket names can start and end only with a letter or number, and cannot contain a period next to a hyphen or another period.

**Syntax**

`$``aws s3 mb <target> [--options]`

The following example creates the `s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket` bucket.

`$``aws s3 mb s3://``amzn-s3-demo-bucket`

## List buckets and objects

    To list your buckets, folders, or objects, use the
        [ s3 ls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/ls.html) command.
      Using the command without a target or options lists all buckets. 

**Syntax**

`$``aws s3 ls <target> [--options]`

For a few common options to use with this command, and examples, see [Frequently used options for s3 commands](#using-s3-commands-managing-objects-param). For a complete list of available
      options, see
        [ s3 ls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/ls.html) in the
        

*AWS CLI Command Reference*.

The following example lists all of your Amazon S3 buckets.

`$``aws s3 ls``2018-12-11 17:08:50 amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 2018-12-14 14:55:44 amzn-s3-demo-bucket2`

The following command lists all objects and prefixes in a bucket. In this example
          output, the prefix `example/` has one file named
            `MyFile1.txt`.

`$``aws s3 ls``s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket``PRE example/ 2018-12-04 19:05:48 3 MyFile1.txt`

You can filter the output to a specific prefix by including it in the command. The
          following command lists the objects in `bucket-name/example/`
          (that is, objects in `bucket-name` filtered by the prefix
            `example/`).

`$``aws s3 ls``s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/example/``2018-12-06 18:59:32 3 MyFile1.txt`

To display only the buckets and objects in a specific region, use the
            `--region` options

`$``aws s3 ls``--region us-east-2``2018-12-06 18:59:32 3 MyFile1.txt`

If you have a large list of buckets and objects, you can paginated the results using
          the `--max-items` or `--page-size` options. The
            `--max-items` option limits how many total buckets and objects are returned
          in a call and the `--page-size` option limits how many of those are listed on a
          page.

`$``aws s3 ls``--max-items 100 --page-size 10`

For more information on pagination, see [How to use the --page-size parameter](./cli-usage-pagination.html#cli-usage-pagination-pagesize) and [How to use the --max-items parameter](./cli-usage-pagination.html#cli-usage-pagination-maxitems).

## Delete buckets

    To delete a bucket, use the
        [ s3 rb](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/rb.html) command. 

**Syntax**

`$``aws s3 rb <target> [--options]`

The following example removes the `s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket` bucket.

`$``aws s3 rb``s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket`

By default, the bucket must be empty for the operation to succeed. To remove a bucket
          that's not empty, you need to include the `--force` option. If you're using a
          versioned bucket that contains previously deleted—but retained—objects, this
          command does *not* allow you to remove the bucket. You must first
          remove all of the content.

The following example deletes all objects and prefixes in the bucket, and then deletes the bucket.

`$``aws s3 rb``s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket`--force

## Delete objects

    To delete objects in a bucket or your local directory, use the
        [ s3 rm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/rm.html) command. 

**Syntax**

`$``aws s3 rm <target> [--options]`

For a few common options to use with this command, and examples, see [Frequently used options for s3 commands](#using-s3-commands-managing-objects-param). For a complete list of options,
      see
        [ s3 rm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/rm.html) in the
        

*AWS CLI Command Reference*.

The following example deletes `filename.txt` from
            `s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/example`.

`$``aws s3 rm s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/example/filename.txt`

The following example deletes all objects from
            `s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/example` using the `--recursive`
          option.

`$``aws s3 rm s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/example --recursive`

## Move objects

    Use the
        [ s3 mv](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/mv.html) command
      to move objects from a bucket or a local directory. The 

`s3 mv` command copies the
      source object or file to the specified destination and then deletes the source object or
      file.**Syntax**

`$``aws s3 mv <source> <target> [--options]`

For a few common options to use with this command, and examples, see [Frequently used options for s3 commands](#using-s3-commands-managing-objects-param). For a complete list of available
      options, see
        [ s3 mv](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/mv.html) in the
        

*AWS CLI Command Reference*.

###### Warning

If you are using any type of access point ARNs or access point aliases in your Amazon S3
        source or destination URIs, you must take extra care that your source and destination Amazon S3
        URIs resolve to different underlying buckets. If the source and destination buckets are the
        same, the source file or object can be moved onto itself, which can result in accidental
        deletion of your source file or object. To verify that the source and destination buckets
        are not the same, use the `--validate-same-s3-paths` parameter, or set the
        environment variable [AWS_CLI_S3_MV_VALIDATE_SAME_S3_PATHS](./cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-list-AWS_CLI_S3_MV_VALIDATE_SAME_S3_PATHS)`true`.

The following example moves all objects from
            `s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/example` to
            `s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/`.

`$``aws s3 mv s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/example s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/`

The following example moves a local file from your current working directory to the
          Amazon S3 bucket with the `s3 mv` command.

`$``aws s3 mv filename.txt s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket`

The following example moves a file from your Amazon S3 bucket to your current working
          directory, where `./` specifies your current working directory.

`$``aws s3 mv s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/filename.txt ./`

## Copy objects

    Use the
        [ s3 cp](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/cp.html) command
      to copy objects from a bucket or a local directory. 

**Syntax**

`$``aws s3 cp <source> <target> [--options]`

You can use the dash parameter for file streaming to standard input (`stdin`)
      or standard output (`stdout`). 

###### Warning

If you're using PowerShell, the shell might alter the encoding of a CRLF or add a CRLF to piped input or output, or redirected output.

The `s3 cp` command uses the following syntax to upload a file stream from
        `stdin` to a specified bucket.

**Syntax**

`$``aws s3 cp - <target> [--options]`

The `s3 cp` command uses the following syntax to download an Amazon S3 file stream
      for `stdout`.

**Syntax**

`$``aws s3 cp <target> [--options] -`

For a few common options to use with this command, and examples, see [Frequently used options for s3 commands](#using-s3-commands-managing-objects-param). For the complete list of
      options, see
        [ s3 cp](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/cp.html) in the
        

*AWS CLI Command Reference*.

The following example copies all objects from
            `s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/example` to
          `s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/`.

`$``aws s3 cp s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/example s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/`

The following example copies a local file from your current working directory to the
          Amazon S3 bucket with the `s3 cp` command.

`$``aws s3 cp filename.txt s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket`

The following example copies a file from your Amazon S3 bucket to your current working
          directory, where `./` specifies your current working directory.

`$``aws s3 cp s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/filename.txt ./`

The following example uses echo to stream the text "hello world" to the
            `s3://bucket-name/filename.txt` file.

`$``echo "hello world" | aws s3 cp - s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/filename.txt`

The following example streams the
            `s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/filename.txt` file to `stdout`
          and prints the contents to the console.

`$``aws s3 cp s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/filename.txt -``hello world`

The following example streams the contents of `s3://bucket-name/pre` to
            `stdout`, uses the `bzip2` command to compress the files, and
          uploads the new compressed file named `key.bz2` to
            `s3://bucket-name`.

`$``aws s3 cp s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/pre - | bzip2 --best | aws s3 cp - s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/key.bz2`

## Sync objects

    The
        [ s3 sync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/sync.html)
      command synchronizes the contents of a bucket and a directory, or the contents of two buckets.
      Typically, 

`s3 sync` copies missing or outdated files or objects between the source
      and target. However, you can also supply the `--delete` option to remove files or
      objects from the target that are not present in the source. **Syntax**

`$``aws s3 sync <source> <target> [--options]`

For a few common options to use with this command, and examples, see [Frequently used options for s3 commands](#using-s3-commands-managing-objects-param). For a complete list of options,
      see
        [ s3 sync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/sync.html) in
      the 

*AWS CLI Command Reference*.

The following example synchronizes the contents of an Amazon S3 prefix named
            *path* in the bucket named *amzn-s3-demo-bucket* with the
          current working directory. 

`s3 sync` updates any files that have a size or modified time that are
          different from files with the same name at the destination. The output displays specific
          operations performed during the sync. Notice that the operation recursively synchronizes
          the subdirectory `MySubdirectory` and its contents with
            `s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path/MySubdirectory`.

`$``aws s3 sync . s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path``upload: MySubdirectory\MyFile3.txt to s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path/MySubdirectory/MyFile3.txt upload: MyFile2.txt to s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path/MyFile2.txt upload: MyFile1.txt to s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path/MyFile1.txt`

The following example, which extends the previous one, shows how to use the
            `--delete` option.

`// Delete local file``$``rm ./MyFile1.txt``// Attempt sync without --delete option - nothing happens``$``aws s3 sync . s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path``// Sync with deletion - object is deleted from bucket``$``aws s3 sync . s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path --delete``delete: s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path/MyFile1.txt // Delete object from bucket``$``aws s3 rm s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path/MySubdirectory/MyFile3.txt``delete: s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path/MySubdirectory/MyFile3.txt // Sync with deletion - local file is deleted``$``aws s3 sync s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path . --delete``delete: MySubdirectory\MyFile3.txt // Sync with Infrequent Access storage class``$``aws s3 sync . s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path --storage-class STANDARD_IA`

When using the `--delete` option, the `--exclude` and
            `--include` options can filter files or objects to delete during an ```
s3
            sync
```
 operation. In this case, the parameter string must specify files to exclude
          from, or include for, deletion in the context of the target directory or bucket. The
          following shows an example.

`Assume local directory and s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path currently in sync and each contains 3 files: MyFile1.txt MyFile2.rtf MyFile88.txt '''``// Sync with delete, excluding files that match a pattern. MyFile88.txt is deleted, while remote MyFile1.txt is not.``$``aws s3 sync . s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path --delete --exclude "path/MyFile?.txt"``delete: s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path/MyFile88.txt '''``// Sync with delete, excluding MyFile2.rtf - local file is NOT deleted``$``aws s3 sync s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path . --delete --exclude "./MyFile2.rtf"``download: s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path/MyFile1.txt to MyFile1.txt ''' // Sync with delete, local copy of MyFile2.rtf is deleted``$``aws s3 sync s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path . --delete``delete: MyFile2.rtf`

## Frequently used options for s3 commands

    The following options are frequently used for the commands described in this topic. For a
      complete list of options you can use on a command, see the specific command in the
        [AWS CLI version 2 reference
      guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/index.html).

- **acl**
- 
          `s3 sync`and`s3 cp`can use the`--acl`option. This enables you to set the access permissions for files copied to Amazon S3. The`--acl`option accepts`private`,`public-read`, and`public-read-write`values. For more information, see[Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#canned-acl)in the*Amazon S3 User Guide*.`$``aws s3 sync . s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path --acl public-read`
- **exclude**
- 
          When you use the `s3 cp`,`s3 mv`,`s3 sync`, or`s3 rm`command, you can filter the results by using the`--exclude`or`--include`option. The`--exclude`option sets rules to only exclude objects from the command, and the options apply in the order specified. This is shown in the following example.`Local directory contains 3 files: MyFile1.txt MyFile2.rtf MyFile88.txt``// Exclude all .txt files, resulting in only MyFile2.rtf being copied``$``aws s3 cp . s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path --exclude "*.txt"``// Exclude all .txt files but include all files with the "MyFile*.txt" format, resulting in, MyFile1.txt, MyFile2.rtf, MyFile88.txt being copied``$``aws s3 cp . s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path --exclude "*.txt" --include "MyFile*.txt"``// Exclude all .txt files, but include all files with the "MyFile*.txt" format, but exclude all files with the "MyFile?.txt" format resulting in, MyFile2.rtf and MyFile88.txt being copied``$``aws s3 cp . s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path --exclude "*.txt" --include "MyFile*.txt" --exclude "MyFile?.txt"`
- **include**
- 
          When you use the `s3 cp`,`s3 mv`,`s3 sync`, or`s3 rm`command, you can filter the results using the`--exclude`or`--include`option. The`--include`option sets rules to only include objects specified for the command, and the options apply in the order specified. This is shown in the following example.`Local directory contains 3 files: MyFile1.txt MyFile2.rtf MyFile88.txt``// Include all .txt files, resulting in MyFile1.txt and MyFile88.txt being copied``$``aws s3 cp . s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path --include "*.txt"``// Include all .txt files but exclude all files with the "MyFile*.txt" format, resulting in no files being copied``$``aws s3 cp . s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path --include "*.txt" --exclude "MyFile*.txt"``// Include all .txt files, but exclude all files with the "MyFile*.txt" format, but include all files with the "MyFile?.txt" format resulting in MyFile1.txt being copied``$``aws s3 cp . s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path --include "*.txt" --exclude "MyFile*.txt" --include "MyFile?.txt"`
- **grant**
- 
          The `s3 cp`,`s3 mv`, and`s3 sync`commands include a`--grants`option that you can use to grant permissions on the object to specified users or groups. Set the`--grants`option to a list of permissions using the following syntax. Replace`Permission`,`Grantee_Type`, and`Grantee_ID`with your own values.**Syntax**`--grants``Permission`=`Grantee_Type`=`Grantee_ID`[`Permission`=`Grantee_Type`=`Grantee_ID`...]Each value contains the following elements: - 
              `Permission`– Specifies the granted permissions. Can be set to`read`,`readacl`,`writeacl`, or`full`.
- 
              `Grantee_Type`– Specifies how to identify the grantee. Can be set to`uri`,`emailaddress`, or`id`.
- 
              `Grantee_ID`– Specifies the grantee based on`Grantee_Type`.- 
                  `uri`– The group's URI. For more information, see[Who is a grantee?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ACLOverview.html#SpecifyingGrantee)
- 
                  `emailaddress`– The account's email address.
- 
                  `id`– The account's canonical ID.
 
- 
                  
 For more information about Amazon S3 access control, see [Access control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingAuthAccess.html).The following example copies an object into a bucket. It grants `read`permissions on the object to everyone, and`full`permissions (`read`,`readacl`, and`writeacl`) to the account associated with`user@example.com`.`$``aws s3 cp file.txt s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/ --grants``read=uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers full=emailaddress=user@example.com`You can also specify a nondefault storage class ( `REDUCED_REDUNDANCY`or`STANDARD_IA`) for objects that you upload to Amazon S3. To do this, use the`--storage-class`option.`$``aws s3 cp file.txt s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/``--storage-class REDUCED_REDUNDANCY`
- 
              
- **no-overwrite**
- 
          The `s3 cp`,`s3 mv`, and`s3 sync`commands include a`--no-overwrite`option that you can use to prevent overwriting objects that already exist at the destination.The following example copies an object from a bucket to the local directory only if it does not already exist in the local directory. `$``aws s3 cp --no-overwrite s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/file.txt file.txt`The following example recursively copies files from a local directory to a bucket. It will only copy files that do not already exist in the bucket. `$``aws s3 cp --recursive --no-overwrite /path/to/demo-files/ s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/demo-files/`The following example moves an object from a local directory to a bucket only if it does not already exist in the bucket destination location. `$``aws s3 mv --no-overwrite file.txt s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/file.txt`The following example syncs files from a local directory to a bucket. It will only sync files that do not already exist in the destination bucket. `$``aws s3 sync --no-overwrite /path/to/demo-files/ s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/demo-files/`
- **recursive**
- 
          When you use this option, the command is performed on all files or objects under the specified directory or prefix. The following example deletes `s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path`and all of its contents.`$``aws s3 rm s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/path --recursive`
